# Project 3 - *Instagram*

**Instagram** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [X ] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [ X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [ X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [ X] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [ X] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [ X] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and creation
- [ X] User can use a tab bar to switch between all "Instagram" posts and posts published only by the user.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [ X] User Profiles:
- [ X] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
- [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
- [ X] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page
- [ ] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen.
- [ ] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen.
- [ X] Run your app on your phone and use the camera to take the photo


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I think the UI overall could be much better, but specifically the process of posting an image can be cleaner. It would be cool to have a custom camera where you can add filters and take photos on the actual instagram app, which I know is possible if I had more time to work on it.
2. Another thing that I would have liked to explore had we had more time is adding a location. I've always wondered how the location posting works from the backend so it would be cool to incorporate it into my project.
